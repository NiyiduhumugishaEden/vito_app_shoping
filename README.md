Virtual Try-On (ViTO) Project üëåüëå

Overview

The Virtual Try-On (ViTO) project enables a virtual shopping experience where customers interact with products using facial recognition and gesture detection. Customers are recognized based on their faces captured via webcam, and they can interact with virtual products by displaying gestures like an "OK" sign. This README provides an overview of the project, setup instructions, usage guidelines, and integration with Arduino for Bluetooth communication.üòéüòé


Files and Structure
The project includes several key files and directories:

01_create_dataset.py: Captures grayscale images of customers' faces using a webcam, saves them, and stores metadata (customer name, image path) in a SQLite database.

02_create_clusters.py: Automates organization of face images into clusters based on features extracted from a VGG16 model, ensuring dataset cleanliness.

03_rearrange_data.py: Cleans data by moving images to 'dataset' directory, checking data integrity against SQLite database, and maintaining consistency.

04_train_model.py: Trains LBPH face recognizer using dataset images, detects faces with Haar Cascade Classifier, and saves the trained model.

05_make_predictions.py: Implements real-time face recognition using trained LBPH model, detects faces via webcam feed, predicts customer identities, and manages interactions with virtual products.

shop.py: Integrates face recognition with product interaction, allowing recognized customers to interact with virtual products by displaying gestures like "OK" sign.

models/: Directory with trained models (LBPH face recognizer, product detection).

Glasses/: Directory with overlay images (sunglasses) for virtual try-on.

customer_faces_data.db: SQLite database storing customer data (names, IDs, recognition metadata) and shopping cart information.

arduino_communication.ino: Arduino script enabling Bluetooth communication with the ViTO application using an HR-05 Bluetooth module.

dataset/: Directory to be created for storing captured face images.

Dependencies
Ensure these dependencies are installed to run the project:

Python 3.x
OpenCV (opencv-python)
NumPy (numpy)
Keras (keras)
SQLite3 (sqlite3)
cvzone (cvzone for image overlay)
Arduino IDE for uploading arduino_communication.ino to Arduino board
Install dependencies using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install opencv-python numpy keras sqlite3 cvzone
Setup Instructions
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
cd vito-project
Create dataset directory:

Before running 01_create_dataset.py, create a directory named dataset in the root of the project:

bash
Copy code
mkdir dataset
Setup dataset:

Run 01_create_dataset.py to capture customer faces, save them into the dataset directory, and populate the SQLite database with customer metadata.

Train face recognition model:

Execute 04_train_model.py to train LBPH face recognizer using captured dataset.

Upload Arduino script:

Upload arduino_communication.ino to Arduino board connected to HR-05 Bluetooth module.

Run the application:

Launch shop.py to start Virtual Try-On (ViTO) application. Ensure webcam is connected and functioning properly.

Interact with the application:

Position yourself in front of webcam.
System recognizes face and displays dynamically fetched name from SQLite database.
Interact with virtual products by displaying gestures (e.g., "OK" sign) to add to shopping cart.
Use 'q' key to exit application.

Arduino Integration 
Connect Arduino:

Connect Arduino board with HR-05 Bluetooth module to computer running ViTO application.

Upload Script:

Use Arduino IDE to open arduino_communication.ino script and upload it to Arduino board.

Communication:

Arduino receives Bluetooth messages from ViTO application. Ensure Bluetooth communication settings (e.g., baud rate) match in both Arduino script and Python code.
